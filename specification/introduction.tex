\section{Introduction}

The aim of this project is to provide a suitable independent practice tool for students attempting to pass their CAA radio telephony (RT) exam. RT is a subset of English designed for clarity and simplicity but its very particular syntax and semantics varies from normal spoken English.
The RT exam consists of a student performing a series of radio calls to simulate a full takeoff to landing flight, during which various events which they must respond correctly to may occur.
The examiner plays the part of air traffic control (ATC) and occasionally the role of other simulated pilots in the area.
A student attempting to obtain their Flight Radiotelephony Operator's License, one part of a private pilot's licence, must pass this exam.
