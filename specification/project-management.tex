\subsection{Risk Assessment}
The risks involved in this project are primarily related to the people and technologies required to build it.
The technology risks include access to the APIs that will be relied upon to obtain data which I cannot feasilbly obtain myself within the scope of the project.
At any time the APIs could be changed or removed, which would require a change in the project scope, but can be somewhat mitigated by keeping features modular, so that they can be removed or replaced with minimal impact on the rest of the system.
The Google Maps API is free for \$200 worth of transactions per month, which should be sufficient for the project. However, it is possible that this limit be reached, which would require reconsidering the use of the API.
The Bing Maps API currently is free for educational use with a limit of 125,000 transactions per year, which could be used as a backup if limits are exceeded on the Google Maps API.
