\section{Objectives}
The following objectives have been developed to reflect the customer's requirements and sorted such that project success can be gauged from the number of high priority requirements satisfied by the final product. Some objectives rely on others and cannot be implemented until prerequisites are completed.

        \hline
        \bf{Num} & \bf{Description} & \bf{Priority} & \bf{Prerequisites} \\
        \hline
        1 & The system will provide scenarios suitable for RT exam practice. & High & None \\
        \hline
        2 & The system will generate random scenarios with suitable random locations, events and radio messages. & Medium & 1 \\
        \hline
        3 & The system will allow students to respond to scenarios and provide feedback on responses. & High & 1 \\
        \hline
        4 & The system will allow voice responses via a speech to text system. & High & 3 \\
        \hline
        5 & The system will be web based and function correctly on modern browsers. & High & 1 \\
        \hline
        6 & The system will allow students to view progress and statistics of their learning so that the student can see areas to focus on. & Medium & 1, 3 \\
        \hline
        7 & The system will allow students to select smaller parts of scenarios to practice specifically as to not waste time on sections they are already confident with. & Medium & 1, 3 \\
        \hline
        8 & The system will allow students to select a support level ranging from fully guided scenarios to no guidance exam like conditions. & Low & 1, 3 \\
        \hline
        9 & The system will allow students to save for later or share specific scenarios with other students by providing a seed for the random number generator used in scenario generation. & Low & 2 \\
        \hline
        10 & The system will have sub 5 second latency when responding to a user's voice input. & Low & 4 \\
        \hline
