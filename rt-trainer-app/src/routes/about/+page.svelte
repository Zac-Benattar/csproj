			This website was created as part of Zac Benattar's third year computer science project. The <a
				href="https://github.com/Zac-Benattar/csproj">GitHub repository</a
			>
			contains the accompanying code and documents for the project. The fronted was built using
			<a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>, and the backend is a Vite websever built using
			<a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a>. The website is hosted by
			<a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>. This project was developed with assistence from the
			<a href="http://www.southwarwickshireflyingschool.com">South Warwickshire Flying School</a>. I
			am not currently looking for feedback from all users, as the app is still in too early a state
			for wider testing. Eventually I will include a way of contacting me on this page when I need
			feedback.
