\section{Introduction}
Radiotelephony (R/T) is the language of flight crew and air traffic control (ATC) in radio communication. As a specifically structured subset of spoken English, it provides a global standard for aircraft communication when supplemented with Aviation English. Though many countries with high aircraft traffic have their own versions, they all closely follow the international standard as defined by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) in Document 9432 \cite{Doc9432}. In the UK, prospective pilots and flight crew must pass both a R/T theory and practical exam as part of their licensing process. A common process for practising for the practical exam involves learning the CAP413 document which defines standard R/T in UK airspace \cite{CAP413}, then organising mock tests with an examiner. Organising mock tests is expensive and time consuming, hence practice software that imitates exam scenarios are frequently used as part of a student's practice routine. The main issue with existing practice software is the lack of speech input capability. Requiring users to enter their radio messages in text form somewhat limits the quality of the practice. It would thus be useful for trainee pilots to have access to a solo practice system which provides mock test like conditions without the need for an examiner to play the part of ATC, while supporting speech input.
