\begin{abstract}
The UK Civil Aviation Authority's Radio Telephony exam involves a student performing a series of radio calls to simulate a full takeoff to landing flight, during which various events which they must respond correctly to may occur. Practice commonly involves learning a large technical document, then organising mock tests with an examiner. Online solo practice systems lack the ability to speak the radio calls into the user's device microphone, leaving space for a new system to include this feature.
