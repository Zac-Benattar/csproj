\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{ch:evaluation}

Describe the approaches you have used to evaluate that the solution you have designed in \ref{ch:design} and executed in \ref{ch:implementation} actually solves the problem identified in \ref{ch:introduction}.

While you can discuss unit testing etc. you have carried here a little bit, that is the minimum. You should present data here and discuss that. This might include \emph{e.g.} performance data you have obtained from benchmarks, survey results, or application telemetry / analytics. Tables and graphs displaying this data are good.

% Mention that although this was a software project, and similar-ish software exists, this was more of an exploratory project which can be further built upon. CRUD capabilities are a solved problem so were not the main focus - the feasibility of the system was demonstrated.

\section{Testing}
\label{se:testing}

% Could test accuracy of weather model against real life?
% Mention David's idea to test system RT against the real flight RT? - Do I still have the file?

\subsection{Unit Testing}
\label{sse:unittesting}
% Im fucked here...

\subsection{Resiliency Testing}
\label{sse:resiliencytesting}
% Identify potential points of failure and determine their resilience

\subsection{Client Feedback}
\label{se:clientfeedback}
% Email David asap!

\section{Project Management}
\label{se:projectmanagement}

\subsection{Project Management Framework}
\label{sse:pmframework}

\subsection{Git, Continuous Deployment and rt-trainer.com}
\label{sse:git-cd-rt-trainer}
% Mention how it was pretty much only David who used the site, and only for the demo page for some reason while the whole system was open to any user who made an account. Talk about the usefulness of the demo, and demo day
