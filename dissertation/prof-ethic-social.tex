No personal data was expected used, and no Non-Disclosure Agreement is expected to be involved. The only personal data related to this project was email addresses which are recorded to the database by Auth.js when a user logs in with an OAuth provider. Not all providers disclose the user's email address to the system, and the address is stored only to identify permitted users, no email communication is performed by the system.
